Given two sets of revenue data (`budget_data_1.csv` and `budget_data_2.csv`), I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

* The final script handles any such similarly structured dataset in the future. In addition, the final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

```

Total Months: 127
Total Revenue: $55945323
Average Change in Revenue: $440514
Greatest Increase in Revenue: Jan-16 ($1837325)
Greatest Decrease in Revenue: Jul-14 ($-1947745)

![vote-counting](Images/vote-counting.jpg)

Tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process given two sets of poll data (`election_data_1.csv` and `election_data_2.csv`). Created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* The final script must be able to handle any such similarly-structured dataset in the future -- so the script needs to work without massive re-writes. In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
